<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>jbSite is designed to be accessible on the start, and you should too for your site!</p>
<p>
    There's so many website in the indie web space that says they are reclaiming the web, but leaves out people who
    just need accessibility tools for visiting the web!
</p>
<p>
    I'm still improving the way jbSite is accessible, so this might change! But, here's the things you should expect on jbSite:

<h1 class="headercolor text-2xl leading-snug">Contact me</h1>
<h3 class="nf headercolor text-2xl leading-snug pt-5">...on Discord</h3>
<p>
    My Discord username is <code>jbcarreon123</code>, and I'm practically online often.
    Please note that I don't always respond on any queries.
    <br>
    The recommended way to reach out to me on Discord is on any of these Discord servers: 
</p>
<div class="flex flex-row gap-4 pl-3" data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover">
    <a href="/">jbCord</a>
    <a href="/">Netherverse Discord</a>
    <a href="/">Lua's Hotel</a>
</div>

<h3 class="nf headercolor text-2xl leading-snug pt-5">...on Bluesky</h3>
<p>
    My Bluesky handle is <code>@jb.is-a.dev</code>, but you might wait for a bit for me to respond.
</p>

<h3 class="nf headercolor text-2xl leading-snug pt-5">...on Mastodon or Twitter</h3>
<p>
    My Mastodon handle is <code>@jbcarreon123@fosstodon.org</code>, and my Twitter handle is <code>@jbcarreon123</code>, but I don't recommend contacting me to these 2 as I'm rarely using them.
</p>

<h3 class="nf headercolor text-2xl leading-snug pt-5">...via Email or Phone</h3>
<p>
    I am currently planning to create a contact email for any queries, but the only issue is that I don't see my email often.
    <br>
    I don't disclose my phone number as it's my personal phone number and I don't want it to be filled with messages or phone calls.
</p>

<h3 class="nf headercolor text-2xl leading-snug pt-5">...via this site</h3>
<p>
    Work in progress...
</p>

<h3 class="nf headercolor text-2xl leading-snug pt-5">Timezones, timezones.</h3>
<p>
    My timezone is GMT+8:00 (or Philippine Standard Time). Yes, I struggle to keep up with US folks.

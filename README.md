# JB's Site v3
because you can't have enough updates on your site

The version 3 of jbcarreon123's site. If you wanna see v1, go to [jbcarreon123/jbs-website](https://github.com/jbcarreon123/jbs-website)!

This version is using SvelteKit instead of a custom coded dynamic SSR on v1.

If you're wondering what happened to v2? We don't talk about that.

Currently deployed to Nekoweb using svelte-adapter-nekoweb, but soon it will be also on Poyoweb.
